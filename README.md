Both the C++ code and python code need to be run in the openCV environment. Besides, if your openCV version is openCV3 or higher, you should install opencv_contrib modules(https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tags) meanwhile. Note that the opencv_contrib version must be consistent with your openCV version.
